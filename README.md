# Magic 8 Ball
_Magic 8 Ball_ is an emulation of the illustrious toy I designed entirely in CSS (no image files) and coded entirely in vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks/libraries).

#### Motivation
Developed in the 1950s and manufactured by Mattel, this renowned toy has stood the test of time spanning almost 4 generations. Predating Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System when most children's toys were made of wood and barn paint, _Magic 8 Ball_ continues to thrive in the era of the _Nintendo Switch_. I decided that this iconic keystone of American childhood deserves to be immortalized in the universality of JavaScript with an accurate emulation.

#### Notes
This emulation is identical to the original toy except a tetrahedron is used to create the illusion of an icosahedron.
