#### Motivation
Developed in the 1950s and manufactured by Mattel, this renowned toy has stood the test of time spanning almost 4 generations. Predating Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System when most children's toys were made of wood and barn paint, Magic 8 Ball continues to thrive in the era of the Nintendo Switch^TM^. I decided that this iconic keystone of American childhood deserves to be immortalized in the universality of JavaScript with an accurate emulation.

#### Notes
This emulation is identical to the original toy except a tetrahedron is used to create the illusion of an icosahedron.
